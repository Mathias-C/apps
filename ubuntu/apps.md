# Terminal Based Apps available through `APT`

Most of the apps are available by launching install.sh in this folder for auto-install.
A Git default configuration might be needed for accessing some of the different folders and packages hosted on Git.
[install.sh](./install.sh) will install all packages listed in [pkglist](./pkglist).

All configurations for these files are located in my dotfiles.

Packages include:

- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/): a smart and user-friendly command line shell with auto-suggestions, history, powerline support.
- [Tmux - the Terminal MUltipleXer](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): Allows you to have several terminal running in one. Also allows for a permanent running environment.
