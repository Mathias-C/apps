# General App Repository

This repository is meant for me to store and share the current set-up I have on my Windows computer with Ubuntu WSL installed. 
It is primarily meant for development in Python and writing in LaTex but can serve other purposes due to the high versatility of VSCode :). 

You can find all the informations about my Windows set-up [here](./windows/apps.md), and the one of the Ubuntu WSL (but will also work on any computer with access to `apt`) set-up [here](./apt_based/apps.md).
